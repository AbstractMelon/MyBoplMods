No longer do you need multiple revive abilities to duplicate! Have infinitely many revives from just one ability!

You can also limit them to some amount, or disable the ability by setting the max to 0.<br>
Configurable at `BepInEx/config/me.antimality.InfiniteReviveUses.cfg`
(You need to open the game once for the config file to appear!)
