# Mods:
## [Time Stop Timer](https://github.com/Antimality/MyBoplMods/releases/tag/TimeStopTimer-v1.0.0 "v1.0.0")
Display how long until time stop starts and how long until it ends
## [Scale Control](https://github.com/Antimality/MyBoplMods/releases/tag/ScaleControl-v1.0.0 "v1.0.0")
Fight like antman! Enlarge and shrink at will to shoot massive arrows and shrink for last minute dodges! 
#### Current Hurdles
Currently works only in local.
For it to work on multiplayer I need to change which inputs the game sends and recieves online. Possible workaround: using steam chat.
## [Default Size](https://github.com/Antimality/MyBoplMods/releases/tag/DefaultSize-v1.0.0 "v1.0.0")
Change the size all blobs start from in each round.

# Ideas:
## Cat & Mouse gamemode
Based on [this](https://youtu.be/aT0UKAuCaTU?si=xn4OOS_zPOlJX7u6) video by Phunix.
One player starts large and the others small.
Add configurations:
* Starting size for cat & mouse
* Random cat/spesific cat (host)
* Disable scale weapons
Add a warning against using with DefaultSize
## Enhanced Grapple
* More than one hook at the same time
* Detatch button
* Longer range
* If connected to player (or anything that isn't a platform) pull it to you instead of going to it
* Shoot a second time to attach to something else like Just Cause?
#### Current Hurdles
Still haven't figured out how this ability works at all
## Rock enhancements:
* Dry Rock:Rock jumps off water for extreme rock plays!
* Cancle Rock: Cancel rock at will 
* Player Rock: Use abilities while in rock form
#### Current Hurdles
No idea if direct control of motion is even possible
Haven't figured out how to control abilities
## Ability Cycle
Change which ability (left/right/middle) get's swichted when picking up a new ability. Either controlled or random.
#### Current Hurdles
None expected, use AbilityStorm for refrence
## Ability Reroll
Reroll abilities once per round. Good for all random games or when you get super countered and need a hail-mary.
## Ride The Lightning
Tesla coil lighting is a solid surface instead of a damaging line. You can still kill directly by squishing, or combo with other abilities, such as Sonic for increased range.
* Bonus, thowable coil?
#### Current Hurdles
No idea how to make/work with Physics objects
## Loadouts
Save/load premade ability loadouts.
* Simpler version: button that sets everyone to all random in ability selection screen.
## Rainbow Player
Character cycles colors constantly. More just a POC to see what is possible.
## Quicker Gust
I just hate the buildup time on gust, make it shorter


# General knowledge I've gained
* Keyboard inputs are easy to accomplish locally but complicated (if even possible) to integrate online: the game only sends/recieves the inputs used by the game.
* The replay files also keep just the input history, which is hilarious if you replay without the original mods.
* How to use config and sync settings across players
